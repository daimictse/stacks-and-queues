1. The main difference between a stack and a queue is that a stack uses first in last out data collections and a queue uses first in first out.

2. The similarities between stacks and queues is that they are data structures storing elements with indexes and have functions to add and remove elements.

3. To implement the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor, I would use the Stack data structure because both UNDO and REDO applies to the very last amongst all actions.
